						Our Ethos is exactly what it says on the box! We believe that we are what we think, do and eat. We strive to help our members and the community to understand the profound relationship between our mind body and nutrition.

						At The Circle we pay due care and attention to this relationship and recognise that there are specific sequential steps that must be followed in the right order to achieve the desired result.

						<p>
							We all have thoughts and beliefs, conscious and subconscious; – some are more deeply ingrained than others, however, they all produce the cocktail of hormones to which we are addicted. The resulting hormones strongly influence how your body behaves; the trick to creating real change is to learn how to change your subconscious thoughts, beliefs and the resultant habits. It is certainly not easy but it certainly is possible when you know how!
						</p>
						<p>
							You may think that you have free will to do as you wish? Your “will”, however, is always subject to your subconscious thoughts and beliefs; therefore, whilst you may feel that you are making conscious free choices,
						</p>
						<p>
							it is mostly your sub-conscious
							that is running your life.
							Think of tasting a lemon…does your mouth start filling with saliva? Of course it does!
						</p>
						<p>
							This is because your thoughts are creating signals in a part of your brain which then travel down to your salivary glands which produces the effect that you feel in your mouth.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything in life starts with a thought, and if you change your mind you will be able to change your life and achieve more of the things that you want.

					<div class="textcontent" id="communitycontent">
						There are some basic needs that are hard wired into our old mammalian brain and are virtually impossible to negotiate with and one of the most “needy” of these is our craving for “belongingness” or the need to be an accepted member of a community or group.
						<br>
						The group can be anything from a football team to a political party or a satisfying working environment.
						<br>
						It dates back to when early man found safety in numbers, looking out for predators and taking comfort from the safety provided as part of a larger group.
						<br>
						However not all groups are necessarily welcoming or actually are designed to fulfil the primary reason why many actually join up!
						<br>
						You may join a gym or a tennis club to make friends and share the experience of something that you enjoy in the company of new friends with whom you share a common interest. Not so in real life in many instances! The primary objective for most, once they join, is to do what they signed up for! They play tennis or golf and of course sometimes will make some acquaintances but for most part carry on as before feeling isolated and alone but now in a new and different environment to the one they felt isolated and alone in before they joined!
						<br>
						At The Circle our Community Programme is primarily about inclusion, belonging, sharing and helping each other! What we actually do is secondary to our primary objective of getting to know each other.
